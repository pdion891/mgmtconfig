data: "This section lists all the built-in resources and their properties. The
resource primitives in `mgmt` are typically more powerful than resources in
other configuration management systems because they can be event based which
lets them respond in real-time to converge to the desired state. This property
allows you to build more complex resources that you probably hadn't considered
in the past.
<br><br>
In addition to the resource specific properties, there are resource properties
(otherwise known as parameters) which can apply to every resource. These are
called [meta parameters](#meta-parameters) and are listed separately. Certain
meta parameters aren't very useful when combined with certain resources, but
in general, it should be fairly obvious, such as when combining the `noop` meta
parameter with the [Noop](noop) resource."
